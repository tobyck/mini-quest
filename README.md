## Mini Quest
### Description
Mini quest is basically a cross between The Mine (a CSS only game by Jamie Coulter) and Smae by @chunkybanana. It's only my second project with HTML canvas so it's quite basic.

### Acknoledgements

- [@chunkybanana](https://github.com/chunkybanana) for helping with the structure of the code and making [Smae](https://smae.surge.sh) for more inspiration.
- The [Slynyrd Blog](https://www.slynyrd.com/blog/2019/8/27/pixelblog-20-top-down-tiles) for the ground tiles.
