## Mini Quest
### Description
Mini quest is basically a cross between The Mine (a CSS only game by Jamie Coulter) and Smae by @chunkybanana. It's only my second project with HTML canvas so it's quite basic, and at the moment it only works on Mac, on lower specced devices the game struggles render fast enough, and on Windows there are some small gaps between tiles that don't appear on Mac. You can play at [miniquest.surge.sh](https://miniquest.surge.sh)
